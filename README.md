# Runtime Calculation of Sort Algorithms with C Programming Language

The user enters the desired array size. The program generates random values between 10 and 1,000,000,000.

The program sorts the same array with Merge, Bubble and Selection Sort.

Each array is run more than 9 times with the same sort algorithm and the average runtime is calculated.

You can compare the compare the performance of three different sort algorithms.
